# Movie Collection Management CLI System

## Overview

**Movie Collection Management CLI System** is a command-line tool for managing a movie database. It allows users to manage movies, genres, and directors through a simple CLI interface. Users can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie records, search for movies, and manage relationships between movies and their genres or directors. The system is built using Python, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Alembic for migrations.

## Features

- **Genre Management**: Add, view, and delete movie genres.
- **Director Management**: Add, view, and delete directors associated with movies.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for movies by title.
- **Database Support**: Uses SQLite for storing movie, genre, and director data.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes pytest-based tests for CRUD operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The main programming language used for the CLI system.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database used for storing data.
- **Alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **pytest**: A framework used for writing and running tests.
